The main issue I had with this lab was getting vim installed on virtualbox. Once I found a good tutorial, then it was smooth sailing from there.I tried using Putty but I found that I liked the interface of virtualbox more. After the setup, I played around with the color scheme for a bit before settling on blue. Now my lab is done!
syntax on
set ruler
set autoindent
set number
set ignorecase
color blue
